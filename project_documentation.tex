\subsection{How it works}
Our system consists of three main views.
The Filter View allows the user to select information of interest.
The Map View displays selected information on a map.
The Graph View shows graphs of the selected information.
When the user selects information of interest in the Filter View, the website posts these parameters to the server, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:dataflow}.
A Django script on the server uses these parameters to form a database query.
The MySQL database returns the requested data to the server, which formats the data into the Map and Graph Views.
