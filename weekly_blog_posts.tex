\subsection{Fall}

\subsubsection{Week 3 Update}
Accomplished last week:​

Met each other, we're all really cool dudes.
We then met with our client, David Lytle, and went over high-level project details to gain better understanding.
Created a rough draft of our project abstract.

Working on this Week:

Setting up touchpoint site and blog (yay).
​Finish final draft of abstract along with problem statement, solutions, etc. 

Goals for next week:

Meet with client for more discussion and updates.
Work on whatever is assigned that week.


\subsubsection{Week 4 Update}
This week, we did not make progress on our project. 
We reached out to schedule a meeting with our sponsor for next week so that we can put together requirements. 
Our goal for next week is to have our requirements document finished.

\subsubsection{Week 5 Update}
This week we met with our TA to introduce ourselves and touch base. 
We also met with our client Dave Lytle and talked about the requirements for the project. 
This meeting gave us a more complete idea of what we were going to create and we then wrote up our requirements document. 

\subsubsection{Week 6 Update}
This week we began revising our requirements document before receiving feedback from our TA in hopes to get a head-start on what sections we think he'll want us to supplement or rewrite. 
We also had a team meeting for divvying up the portions on the technical review document. 
We discussed the technologies we are reviewing for each solution so we could work on our sections on our own time. 
Next week we will have it finished in time for turn in and start looking at the poster assignment. 


\subsubsection{Week 7 Update}
​This week we did our rewrite on the requirement document, which mostly involved making our sharepoint gantt chart fit in a document. 
We also wrote our Technical Review. 
At this point we have a pretty good idea of what technologies we are going to use for each piece of our project.​​​ Next week we will work on our poster and our elevator pitch.

\subsubsection{Week 8 Update}
​This week, we killed it. 
After we finished our technical review last week, we created the first draft of our poster. 
It is very sparse at this point, since we haven't done any implementation. 
However, it will be useful to get feedback on the poster now so that we can improve it for next term. 
We also got an early start on our elevator pitch, which is going to be great.

\subsubsection{Week 9 Update}
After perfecting our elevator pitch to deliver in class we switched our sights to the design document project. 
While we are still in the planning and structure phase of it, we will be begin writing the rough draft Monday next week. 
With the holiday this week we won't be able to accomplish a whole lot, because we're each traveling a bit to visit family and won't be around. 
Week 10 will be a major progress week for us.

\subsubsection{Week 10 Update}
Last week we began assigning portions and planning our design document. 
We had already figured out our elevator speech and delivered that on Tuesday. 
We had a good meeting with our TA Jon Dodge and made sure we were all on the same page for ending the term. 
Our design document is now complete and ready to turn in (via hard-copy and email) and we are starting to plan / divvy up the progress report to turn in during finals week. 

It's been a good term. 
Our teamwork is strong, the project's goals are clear, and we're ready to dive head-first into some development.

\subsection{Winter}

\subsubsection{Week 1 Update}
We neglected our project over break, so we spent this week doing a bit of catching up. 
We worked on installing and configuring everything we need to get up and running.

We will need a web server, so we contacted our client about hosting one. 
In the meantime, we will each host the website on our local machines. 
The code will be kept in sync on GitHub.

We also worked on learning how to set up and use Django. 
We have a Django project and app set up, and this is where we will do our backend development.

We had a bit of diffculty finding a good time for all of us to meet. 
We want to spend a solid block of several hours working together each week. 
This was tricky, but we have settled on Monday evenings at 6:30. 
We worked together well, and spent our time productively.

For next week, we aim to have our web layout finished so there is something to look at. 
We will also start working on manipulating the data into a relational database.

\subsubsection{Week 2 Update}
This week, we created our basic web layout. 
We have a website, and it has a header and sections for each of the three main sections. 
It uses bootstrap nicely, so that browser window size doesn't make our layout ugly. 
The whole thing looks pretty slick. 
Actually, it looks ugly as sin and has no content, but it's still impressive for a first start.

In the underlying code, each ​section (Map View, Statistics View, Filter View) is a separate view in a separate file. 
We've assigned each team member to bring one view to alpha level functionality. 
This will mean each view pulling in static data from the database. 
Beta level will be allowing the filter view to actually control what is displayed in the map and graph views.

We worked well together this week. 
We are meeting for a few hours a week to go over group stuff, and now have separate tasks to work on in the meantime. 
We should be meeting with our TA later this week. 
We still need to hear back from our client to get the cleaned up data, a hosting site, and an ArcGIS account though.

Next week, we will make  a script to import the raw data into our database. 
This will be a big part of our alpha release. 
Once we have data, we can actually display it and make it look pretty. 
Hopefully, we can also start including that data in our views by next week as well.

\subsubsection{Week 3 Update - Jasper}
My task for this week was to finish alpha level functionality for the Filter View. 
I finished this on time, but had to meet with Ty to figure out how to merge it into master. 
I am yet a Git padawan. 
Our meeting was more training on Degobah than productive work. 
Stil, we got it merged, and now the filter view looks pretty.

The goal for this coming week is to start a script for importing the database from a CSV file. 
We will work on this as a team, and we will need to meet with our sponsor first to clarify how the Database is to be set up.

\subsubsection{Week 4 Update - Jasper}
This week was a little slow. 
I meant to make enhancements to the Filter View this week, but did not get around to it. 
I did meet with the team to make our plan of attack for the midterm report. 
We created a skeleton of the report. 
We also started the database import process. 
Our goal for next week is to have the website ready for alpha release. 
This way, we can spend the following week focusing on writing it up and doing the video.​

\subsubsection{Week 5 Update - Jasper}
This was a productive week. 
Our team finished the database import script, so we are now ready to start supplying real data to the website. 
I made the necessary additions and enhancements to the Filter View to get it ready for the alpha release. 
These turned out to be relatively straightforward. 
I also drafted my parts of the progress report. 
I may need to add more content later. 
Next week, our team will meet to finish the progress report and make the video.​ I'm pleased with our progress.

\subsubsection{Week 6 Update - Jasper}
This week, I did my parts for the alpha release. 
We got together as a team on Monday and recorded the video. 
I gave an introduction to the project and talked about my contribution to the Filter View. 
I also completed my writing sections for the report. 
I wrote about the progress and work needed for the Filter View, as well as an intro and an overview of the graphs we will include for our beta release. 
This was all relatively straightforward, since I had finished the necessary code last week. 
Next week, we are working on getting data from the databse to actually display on the database. 
My goal is to populate the Filter View with the actual data.

\subsection{Spring}

\subsubsection{Week 2 Update - Jasper}
This week, our team met to assign jobs for the 1.0 release. 
Most of our tasks involved fixing bugs. 
In fact, we powered through a bunch of bugs at our meeting. 
I fixed ​the NULL and repeat entries that were showing up in the filter view, which makes it look much cleaner. 
In fact, our website overall is looking much cleaner. 
Hopefully, we'll be able to fix our last bugs soon and proceed to our stretch goals. 
Exciting!

\subsubsection{Week 5 Update - Jasper}
This week, we got everything ready for the upcoming deadlines. 
I am finished with all of my assigned issues on GitHub. 
I finished my sections of the report, which had only minor edits to make. 
I also made the necessary changes to my sections of the video, which were also minor.

I forgot my blog posts during the last several weeks, during which time I was mainly working on my issues on GitHub. 
We also met with our sponsor's grad student during that time to show him the current state of our product. 
He was really pleased with it.

Next week, I'll probably be focused on my thesis, but if I have some spare time, I might get a start on the final documentation, if the assignment for that is up by then.

\subsubsection{Week 10 Update - Jasper}
It's the end of Senior Capstone! 
Last week, we got our final report set up and assigned tasks. 
This week, we finished our final video presentation. 
Now all that's left to do is finish up the final report and write group evaluations. 
It's been a great year, and I'm really pleased with how Capstone has gone.
